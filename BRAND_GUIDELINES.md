## Motion & Animation

### Animation Principles
1. **Purpose:** Every animation serves a functional purpose
2. **Subtlety:** Movements are gentle, not distracting
3. **Speed:** Fast enough to feel responsive (150-300ms)
4. **Easing:** Natural acceleration/deceleration curves

### Standard Timings
- Micro-interactions: 150ms (hover, focus)
- Component transitions: 250ms (modals, dropdowns)
- Page transitions: 300ms (route changes)
- Loading states: 500ms minimum before showing spinner

### Easing Functions
- Default: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) - Material standard
- Bounce: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55) - Playful moments
- Smooth: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1) - Gentle movements

### Key Animations

**Aurora Wave (Brand Signature):**
```css
@keyframes aurora {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0) translateX(0);
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-10px) translateX(10px);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
/* Duration: 8s, Easing: ease-in-out, Infinite */
```

**Pulse (For alerts):**
```css
@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.05);
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}
/* Duration: 2s, Easing: ease-in-out, Infinite */
```

**Slide In (For panels):**
```css
@keyframes slideInRight {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
/* Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out */
```
