## Background Sync

Tracks and hazards sync automatically when connection available.

**How It Works:**
1. User creates track/reports hazard while offline
2. Data saved to IndexedDB pending queue
3. Service worker registers sync event
4. When online, sync automatically triggers
5. Data uploaded to server
6. Local queue cleared on success
7. User notified of sync status

**Sync Tags:**
- `track-sync`: Sync pending GPS tracks
- `hazard-sync`: Sync pending hazard reports

**Retry Logic:**
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- Max 50 retry attempts
- Manual sync trigger available

**Monitoring:**
- Visual indicators on UI:
  - üü¢ Synced (WiFi icon)
  - üü° Queued (WiFi off icon)
  - üîµ Syncing (WiFi icon pulsing)
  - üî¥ Failed (alert icon)
