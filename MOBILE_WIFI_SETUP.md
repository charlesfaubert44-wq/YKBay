## 🌐 **Network Information**

**Your Computer's IP Addresses:**

- Virtual Network: `172.19.144.1`

**Ports:**
- Frontend (Vite): `5173`
- Backend (Express): `5000`

**Protocol:** HTTP (not HTTPS - expected in dev mode)

---

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

### 1. Check WiFi Connection
```
✓ Computer: Connected to WiFi
✓ Phone: Connected to SAME WiFi network
```

### 2. Test on Phone Browser
```
1. Open browser on phone
2. Navigate to: http://192.168.86.35:5173
3. You should see the YK Bay app!
```

### 3. Expected Result
You should see:
- ✅ Northern Lights themed UI
- ✅ Aurora gradient navigation bar
- ✅ Responsive mobile layout

- ✅ No CORS errors in console

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "This site can't be reached" or timeout
**Solutions:**

**1. Verify Same WiFi Network**
- Computer and phone must be on the SAME WiFi
- Check WiFi name on both devices matches

**2. Check Firewall**
Windows Firewall might be blocking connections:
```
1. Windows Settings → Privacy & Security → Windows Security
2. Firewall & network protection
3. Allow an app through firewall
4. Find "Node.js" and check "Private" box
5. Try again
```

**3. Try the Alternate IP**
If `192.168.86.35` doesn't work, try:
```
http://172.19.144.1:5173
```

**4. Restart the Dev Server**
In your terminal, press `Ctrl+C` then:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### Issue: Page loads but gets API errors
**Symptom:**
- UI loads fine
- API calls fail
- Console shows CORS or network errors

**Solution:**
The server CORS is already configured for local network access. If you still get errors:

1. Check server is running on port 5000:
   ```
   http://192.168.86.35:5000/api/health
   ```

2. You should see:
   ```json
   {"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","uptime":...}
   ```

3. If that works but app doesn't, clear browser cache on mobile

---

### Issue: CSS/Styles not loading
**Solution:**
Same as desktop - clear mobile browser cache:

**iOS Safari:**
1. Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data

**Android Chrome:**
1. Chrome Menu → History → Clear browsing data
2. Select "Cached images and files"
