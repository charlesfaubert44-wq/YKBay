# Railway Deployment - FrozenShield Backend üöÇ

## Quick Fix for Railway Build Error

If you saw: `Script start.sh not found` or `Railpack could not determine how to build the app`, this has been fixed!

### Files Added:
- ‚úÖ `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Process configuration
- ‚úÖ `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Updated with Node.js version

## Deploy Backend to Railway (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create New Project

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. Choose: **charlesfaubert44-wq/YKBay**

Railway will now automatically detect:
- Node.js application ‚úÖ
- Start command: `node server/server.js` ‚úÖ
- Build command: `npm install` ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"Add PostgreSQL"**
4. Railway automatically creates and connects the database
5. Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` is auto-provided

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Click on your service ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab ‚Üí Add these:

#### Required Variables:

```bash
# Server
PORT=3002
NODE_ENV=production
HOST=0.0.0.0

# JWT Secret (CHANGE THIS!)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_random_string_here_change_this

# Frontend URL (update after Vercel deployment)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

#### Optional (For Email Features):

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Step 4: Generate Domain

1. Go to **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Networking"**
2. Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://ykbay-production.up.railway.app`
4. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for Vercel

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Click **"Deploy"** (or it auto-deploys)
2. Watch the build logs
3. Wait for: `‚úÖ Build successful`
4. Wait for: `‚úÖ Deployment live`

### Step 6: Initialize Database

After first deployment, initialize your database:

#### Option A: Using Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run database setup
railway run node server/scripts/setupDatabase.js
```

#### Option B: Manual SQL

1. Go to your PostgreSQL database in Railway
2. Click **"Connect"** ‚Üí **"Query"**
3. Run the SQL from `server/scripts/setupDatabase.js`

## Verify Deployment

### Test Backend Health

Visit your Railway URL + `/api/health`:

```
https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "FrozenShield API",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T..."
}
```

### Check Logs

1. Click on your service in Railway
2. View **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click latest deployment
4. View logs to see:
   ```
   üõ°Ô∏è FrozenShield API Server
   üìç Local:   http://localhost:3002
   ‚è∞ Started at ...
   ```

## Troubleshooting Railway Issues

### ‚ùå Build Failed: "Cannot find module"

**Solution:** Missing dependencies. Check your `package.json`:

```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are listed
npm install pdfkit nodemailer moment-timezone
npm install --save
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push
```

Railway will auto-redeploy.

### ‚ùå Deployment Failed: "Port already in use"

**Solution:** Railway provides `PORT` via environment variable.

Ensure your `server/server.js` uses:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3002;
```

### ‚ùå Database Connection Failed

**Solution:** Railway auto-provides `DATABASE_URL`.

**Check:**
1. PostgreSQL service is running
2. Both services are in same project
3. DATABASE_URL is visible in Variables

**Don't manually set DATABASE_URL** - Railway does this automatically.

### ‚ùå "Railpack could not determine how to build"

**Solution:** You've already fixed this! Files added:
- `railway.toml`
- `Procfile`
- `nixpacks.toml`

**If still failing:**
1. Ensure these files are committed to GitHub
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin master`
3. In Railway, click **"Redeploy"**

### ‚ùå Application Crashes on Start

**Check logs for specific error:**

**Common issues:**
1. **Missing environment variables** - Add in Railway Variables
2. **Database not initialized** - Run database setup script
3. **Port binding issue** - Use `HOST=0.0.0.0`

## Railway Configuration Explained

### `railway.toml`
```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"           # Use Nixpacks builder
buildCommand = "npm install"   # Install dependencies

[deploy]
startCommand = "node server/server.js"  # Start server
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"        # Auto-restart on crash
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10            # Max 10 retries
```

### `Procfile`
```
web: node server/server.js
```
Tells Railway this is a web process.

### `nixpacks.toml`
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x"]  # Use Node.js 18

[start]
cmd = "node server/server.js"  # Start command
```

```

**Don't manually set these!** Railway manages them.

### You Must Provide

```bash
PORT=3002                    # Server port
NODE_ENV=production         # Environment
HOST=0.0.0.0               # Bind to all interfaces
JWT_SECRET=random_string    # Authentication secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://...    # Your Vercel URL
```

### Optional (Email)

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
