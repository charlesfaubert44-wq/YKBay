# 🎉 You're Ready to Start!

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. **✅ SQLite Database** - Created and initialized with admin user
2. **✅ Backend Dependencies** - All npm packages installed
3. **✅ Frontend Dependencies** - React app ready to go
4. **✅ Environment Files** - Configured for development
5. **✅ Uploads Directory** - Ready for GPS track files

## 🚀 Start the Application

Open your terminal in `C:\Users\Charles\Desktop\Oct29\YK Bay` and run:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Backend API** on http://localhost:3001
- **Frontend App** on http://localhost:5173

## 🔑 Login Credentials

```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

**IMPORTANT:** Change this password after first login!

## 🗺️ About the Map

The map will show a **placeholder** because you need a real Mapbox token.

### To Get Real Maps:

1. **Sign up for free:** https://www.mapbox.com/signup/
2. **Get your token:** Go to Account → Tokens
3. **Add to client/.env:**
   ```
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your_real_token_here
   ```
4. **Restart the dev server**

**Free tier includes:** 50,000 map loads per month (plenty for testing!)

## 🧪 Test Features

### 1. Explore the Map
- Navigate to the Map view
- Toggle layers (heatmap, hazards, routes)
- Change map styles (satellite, dark, outdoors)

### 2. Upload a Test Track
- Go to "Upload Track"
- Use the sample file: `examples/sample-track.gpx`
- Fill in vessel and condition info
- Submit!

### 3. Check Dashboard
- View your statistics
- See community leaderboard
- Track your contributions

### 4. Try Different Users
- Register a new account
- Upload tracks from different accounts
- See how the community features work

## 📂 Important Files

```
YK Bay/
├── database.sqlite          # Your SQLite database
├── .env                     # Backend config
├── client/.env              # Frontend config (Mapbox token)
├── uploads/                 # Uploaded GPS tracks
└── START_HERE.md           # Setup guide
```

## 🔧 Common Commands

```powershell
# Start development server (backend + frontend)
npm run dev

# Reset database
npm run db:setup-sqlite

# Install new backend dependency
npm install package-name

# Install new frontend dependency
cd client && npm install package-name
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations (SQLite Mode)

Since you're using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL:

- ❌ No spatial queries (PostGIS features)
- ❌ Simplified geometry handling
- ❌ Some advanced route analysis limited
- ✅ Great for testing and development!

**To unlock full features:** Install PostgreSQL + PostGIS
(See [INSTALL_POSTGRESQL.md](INSTALL_POSTGRESQL.md))

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```powershell
# Check for port conflicts
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill process if needed
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Frontend won't start
```powershell
# Same for port 5173
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Map not loading
- Check `client/.env` has Mapbox token
- Token must start with `pk.`
- Restart dev server after adding token

### Can't login
- Make sure backend is running (http://localhost:3001/api/health)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try resetting database: `npm run db:setup-sqlite`

## 📊 Check if Everything is Working

### 1. Backend Health Check
Open: http://localhost:3001/api/health

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "uptime": 123.45
}
```

### 2. Frontend Loads
Open: http://localhost:5173

Should see:
- ✅ Northern lights themed header
- ✅ Navigation menu
- ✅ Map view (with or without Mapbox)

### 3. Login Works
- Use admin / admin123
- Should redirect to dashboard
- See your stats and leaderboard

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Get Mapbox token** (5 minutes, free!)
2. **Upload sample track** from `examples/` folder
3. **Explore all features** - dashboard, map, upload
4. **Customize for your area** - Edit coordinates in `MapView.jsx`
5. **Add real data** - Upload your own GPS tracks
